Workforce Intelligence Platform
CGI AIS SCLC 2026 – Business Analytics Competition
📌 Project Overview: 
This project develops an end-to-end workforce analytics solution to analyze the growing U.S. IT talent shortage using publicly available datasets from Data.gov (387,179+ datasets available).
The platform integrates labor market data, education output statistics, wage information, and H1B visa issuance data to:
Measure the IT talent gap
Quantify economic impact of unfilled roles
Forecast future workforce trends
Simulate visa-based “what-if” scenarios
The goal is to transform raw government data into actionable, decision-support insights.
